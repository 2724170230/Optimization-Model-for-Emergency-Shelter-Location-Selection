# Optimization-Model-for-Emergency-Shelter-Location-Selection
We used Tableau to construct the frequency maps of various natural disasters across all counties in US since 1954 based on the FEMA dataset. We constructed the SVI *Population map graph by multiplying the E_TOPTOP((Population estimate) and F_TOTAL (Sum of flags for the four SVI themes). We allow users to input the counties affected by a real-world disaster and assign each county with a weight according to its SVI * Population value (greater the population or/and SVI index, greater the weight). We employed RANSAC linearization model to calculate the optimized location of shelter that to the greatest extent help the people in need. This location is transferred to the disaster-frequency map to inform the users the safety of the location in the face of a particular disaster. We allow users themselves to determine the balance between the location that help most people in need and the location that is the relatively safe in a particular disaster.
